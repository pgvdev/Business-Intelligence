<h1>Business-Intelligence</h1>

<h3>Design and Implementation</h3>


These essential steps should be followed with the goal to implement and design a business intelligence tool for General Motors Ltd. that will support advanced problem-solving and decision-making that is in line with GM's requirements:
<p>1.	Establishing Specific Tasks and Goals</p>
Utilising data on carbon emissions to identify countries with a high potential for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).
<p>•	Analyse Carbon Emissions Data: Evaluate the data to gain insight about the impact on the environment and market availability, such as total emissions, emissions per capita, and energy consumption.</p>
<p>•	Analyse Other Relevant Factors: Consider the EV market size, the environment for regulation, and the general availability of infrastructure for charging EVs.</p>
<p>2.	Gathering and Preparing Data</p>
<p>•	Data Sources: Collect data related to carbon emissions, considering energy consumption, per-capita emissions, and total emissions. Utilise Excel's geographic function to extract and calculate key information applicable to an analysis of EV adoption.</p>

<p>•	Upload the Data: Select Excel spreadsheets to start the data upload process from the Home ribbon's Data section in Power BI tool. You can choose to load or transform the data in the Navigator to ensure accuracy by using the preview feature offered by the Navigator to confirm that Power BI is loading the proper data range before moving further.</p>

<p>•	Data Transformation and Cleaning: Using Power BI's Power Query Editor to make sure the data is clear, organised, and prepared for precise analysis, this step involves deleting duplicates, fixing errors, and formatting different data types.</p>

<p>3.	Use Power BI for Designing the BI Solution</p>

<p>•	Dashboard Creation: Utilise Power BI to create a dashboard that indicates different countries with great potential for EV adoption by visualising data on carbon emissions.</p>

<p>•	Data Visualisations: Use a variety of graphs and charts to visually present emissions data. Stakeholders will find it easier to read and understand the data as a result of these visual elements.</p>
